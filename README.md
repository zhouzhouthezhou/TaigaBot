# Dependencies
Python Dependencies
---
* Python 3
* discord.py
* PyNaCl
* youtube-dl

System Depedencies
---
* Opus (libopus0 on ubuntu)
* ffmpeg

# Setup
Once all the dependecies are installed setting up TaigaBot is fairly trivial.

Fork the repo and follow the following steps:

First, in order to link TaigaBot to your discord bot, you need to create a file named `taigaBot.token` in the src directory. This is where you will copy your bot's token to link the discord bot to TaigaBot. **Make sure there is only one line in the file**

Finally, to add the custom commands functionality you need to create a file named `commands.json` in the src directory and put `{}` into the file. TaigaBot should now be set up. 

Note: If you try to add custom commands and the terminal says something to the tune of `Permission Denied` run the command `sudo chmod 666 commands.json`

Run the bot.py script with the command `python3 bot.py` and TaigaBot should come to life!
